History (194X - 1965):
The Russian People's Republic was forged in the midst of the Second Polish-Bolshevik war
by the exiled Russian Political Committee, headed by the over sixty years old revolutionary Boris Savinkov. The RPK quickly swayed the Russian masses,
promising to bring forth a new Russia, free from the shackles of bolshevism. The anti-communist Russian forces quickly drove
out their opressors out - however, those guilty did not face justice (see Soviet Socialist Republic.txt).
